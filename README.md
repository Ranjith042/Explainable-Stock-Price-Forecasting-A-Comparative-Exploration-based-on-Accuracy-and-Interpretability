# Explainable-Stock-Price-Forecasting-A-Comparative-Exploration-based-on-Accuracy-and-Interpretability
• Engineered features from diverse datasets including Nifty 50, technical indicators, market sentiment, macro-economic
factors, and global market ( Dow jones and Shanghai index) to predict stock prices.

• Implemented time series forecasting with Facebook Prophet model, achieving high accuracy with 0.48% SMAPE.

• Built fuzzy logic system using Mamdani approach for transparency into predictions with SMAPE of 2.51%.

• Evaluated model accuracy using SMAPE, MPE and visualized model fit, residuals to compare two models’ performance.

• Global and local interpretability of both the models were assessed to check their practical applicability in the real world.

• Analyzed variable contributions and causal relationships within models to assess alignments with domain knowledge.

• Identified tradeoffs between predictive accuracy favoring Prophet and interpretability favoring Mamdani.

• Proposed ensembling Prophet and Mamdani to develop accurate yet interpretable hybrid models.

• Communicated analysis and results through well-structured dissertation and presentation to external markers.
